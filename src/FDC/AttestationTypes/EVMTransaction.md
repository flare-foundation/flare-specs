| `logIndices`            | `uint32[]`    | If `listEvents` is `false`, this should be an empty list, otherwise, the request is rejected. If `listEvents` is `true`, this is the list of indices (logIndex) of the events to be relayed (sorted by the requestor). The array should contain at most 50 indices. If empty, it indicates all events in order capped by 50. |

Note that events (logs) are indexed in block not in each transaction.
The contract that uses the attestation should specify the order of event logs as needed and the requestor should sort `logIndices`
with respect to the set specifications.

The fields are in line with [transaction](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactionbyhash) provided by EVM node.

An `Event` is a struct with the following fields:

| Field            | Solidity type | Description                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `logIndex`       | `uint32`      | The consecutive number of the event in block.                                                       |
| `emitterAddress` | `address`     | The address of the contract that emitted the event.                                                 |
| `topics`         | `bytes32[]`   | An array of up to four 32-byte strings of indexed log arguments.                                    |
| `data`           | `bytes`       | Concatenated 32-byte strings of non-indexed log arguments. At least 32 bytes long.                  |
| `removed`        | `bool`        | It is `true` if the log was removed due to a chain reorganization and `false` if it is a valid log. |

The fields are in line with [EVM event logs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_getfilterchanges).

## Lowest Used Timestamp

For `lowestUsedTimestamp`, `timestamp` is used.

## Verification

If a transaction with the `transactionId` is in a block on the main branch with at least `requiredConfirmations`, the specified data is relayed.
The block at the tip is has $1$ confirmation.
If any indicated event does not exist, the request is rejected.


`LowestUsedTimestamp` is limited depending on usual node configurations on different chains.

| Source | `LowestUsedTimestamp` limit |
| ---------------- | ------------- | 
| ETH | 26400000 (2_200_000 blocks * 12 sec (usually nodes keep 2_300_000 blocks)) |
| SGB | unlimited |
| FLR | unlimited |
