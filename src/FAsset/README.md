# Summary
The FAssets protocol is Flare's native protocol for minting on-chain representations of assets from external chains.
By owning FAsset copies of assets from non-smart contract chains, Flare's users are able to harvest the benefits of Flare's DeFi infrastructure, for example by staking them in lending protocols.
FAssets are backed by a system of users known as *agents*, posting collateral that backs FAsset operation in return for fees.

This documentation describes the FAsset system in detail: the minting and redeeming process by which assets enter and leave Flare, the agents and their collateral that insures the system, and technical information regarding the security of the protocol.
