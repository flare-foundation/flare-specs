# Introduction

The Flare Systems Protocol (FSP) is a foundational infrastructure designed to support Flare's enshrined protocols (technically referred to as sub-protocols). Its primary goal is to facilitate secure, efficient, and decentralized consensus mechanisms through weighted voting by a select group of entities known as data providers or voters. These data providers are offchain participants who accrue vote power from the Flare community via delegations of wrapped FLR tokens (WFLR) or stakes.

FSP ensures that agreements on offchain data or calculations are reached securely and fairly, enabling the reliable operation of sub-protocols like the Flare Time Series Oracle and the Flare Data Connector.
